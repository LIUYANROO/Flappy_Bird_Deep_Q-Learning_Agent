## Description

The notebook includes:

- **Implementation of Deep Q-Learning (DQN)** for decision-making in the Flappy Bird game.
- Step-by-step instructions for setting up the agent's training environment.
- Detailed explanations of the algorithms used (DQN, Double DQN, Dueling DQN) and their applications to the problem.
- Model evaluation, visualizations of rewards, and sound effects integration.

## Methods Used

The notebook implements the following techniques and methods:

- **Q-Learning**: Basic Q-learning for the agent to learn optimal actions based on rewards.
- **Deep Q-Network (DQN)**: A neural network used to approximate the Q-values for decision-making.
- **Double DQN**: An enhancement to reduce Q-value overestimation by using two networks (one for action selection and another for Q-value evaluation).
- **Dueling DQN**: Splits the estimation of state values and action advantages, improving decision-making efficiency.
- **Experience Replay**: Stores and samples experiences randomly to improve training efficiency.
- **Sound Effects**: Integrated sound effects (jump, point, hit, die) using **pygame** to enhance training experience.
